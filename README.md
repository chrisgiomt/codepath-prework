## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
One of my goals is to become a machine learning engineer. I love that we can use machines to figure out patterns in Big data to learn more about it. I want to be able to use both my passion for machine learing and app creating to build an app that uses a classification model to identify objects. One app that I have in mind is a galaxy classification app. Since there are many different types of galaxies out there, I would use a multiclass model that is able to classify a galaxy image, that was provided by the user, and identifies its class. For example: a spiral galaxy, elliptical, irregular... I heard that iOS has core ML to run machine learning models. So maybe, to create the model itself, i would use python and PyTorch to train and test the model. Then, once im happy with the results, i would then upload the model to core ML and create an user friendly interface on the iOS app. 


## Notes
- For my first favorite app, I really like the Udemy app. It has the features of being able to save video lectures in offline mode. All a user needs to do is download the specific lecture(s). Another feature it has is being able to recommend a study plan where you can pick what times of the day you would like to study with Udemy. It'll alert the user whenever it hits time to study.
- For my second favorite app, I really like the Amazon app. The search feature seems to know what products a user is looking for and recommends products based on the search. Like ex: face lotion. Another feature it has is allows us to use the gps to see how close the amazon driver is from delivering your package. They definitely use some maps API to handle that feature.
- For my third app, I enjoy using discord app. The app now allows you create your own way of personalizing your discord app. You will need to have a subcription to do that but it is fun regardless customizing the look and feel of our discord interface. Another feature is being able to stream your screen. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
